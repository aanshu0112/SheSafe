## Inspiration
The alarming rise in cases of women assault served as the catalyst for our project at the hackathon. As young women navigating the world, we are deeply committed to fostering positive change and creating a safer environment for everyone. Inspired by our own experiences and those of others, we embarked on a mission to develop SheSafe, an iOS app aimed at providing not just fast, but secure travel options for all.

## Learning Experience
Venturing into uncharted territory, we dove headfirst into the world of iOS app development using Swift and Xcode for the first time. The journey was undeniably challenging yet incredibly rewarding. Through this process, we gained invaluable insights into mobile app development, mastering the intricacies of Swift syntax and leveraging the capabilities of Xcode effectively.

## Project Development
Utilizing Swift and storyboards within Xcode, Apple's developer tool, we meticulously crafted SheSafe to ensure a seamless user experience. Integrating essential libraries such as MapKit and SwiftUI, we empowered the app to retrieve critical user data including battery levels and real-time location. To enhance the functionality of our map, we employed advanced techniques such as pattern recognition based on downloaded Bay Area crime data. Additionally, we developed an innovative algorithm to create a battery circle/length feature, enhancing the app's utility and user-friendliness.

## Challenges Faced
The journey was not without its hurdles. Learning a new programming language, Swift, proved to be a formidable challenge, compounded by our limited prior experience with UX design. We dedicated substantial time to mastering the nuances of Swift and effectively navigating the Xcode IDE. Despite encountering time constraints that prevented us from fully realizing our initial feature set, we are immensely proud of the work we have accomplished. SheSafe represents not just an app, but a beacon of hope for women everywhere, poised to effect meaningful societal change beyond our initial expectations.
